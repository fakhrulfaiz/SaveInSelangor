    "p2": "Section 12(1) of the Malaysian Aviation Consumer Protection Code 2016, gazetted in July 2016, dictates that operating airlines have to provide 'compensation and care' to passengers affected by a flight delay or cancellation. This includes providing an explanation as to the reason for such events and suggesting possible alternative transport.",
    "p3": "However, the airline may not be obligated to do so if they can prove that the delay or cancellation is caused by unavoidable circumstances such as cases of war, weather conditions unfavorable for flight, security risks, unexpected flight safety shortcomings, and strikes that affect airline operations.",
    "p4": "Passengers should be able to choose between: \n1. Reimbursement of the full costs of the ticket at the price at which it was bought (including taxes and fees) within 30 days, for the part(s) of the journey not made and the part(s) already made if the flight no longer serves any purpose in the passenger's original travel plan; OR\n2. Re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at the earliest opportunity or at a later date at the passenger's convenience (subject to seat availability) at no extra charge."
