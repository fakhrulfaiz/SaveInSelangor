    "p2": "The first thing you need to do is file a written complaint with your airline. Your complaint should be filed within 7 days of arrival if your baggage is lost or damaged, or within 21 days of arrival if your baggage is delayed.",
    "p3": "If you reach your destination but your bag doesn't, go buy a few sets of clothes and any toiletries you need - you'll be claiming for these necessities against your airline later. Keep the receipts because you'll need to provide proof of your claim through receipts and any proof of the value of your lost items (like the price of your devices).",
    "p4": "Paragraph 13(2) and (5) of the Malaysian Aviation Consumer Protection Code 2016 state that the maximum liability of an airline if they lose your luggage is about RM6400 - based on the exchange rate at the time of writing (28th Feb 2018) of 1131 Special Drawing Rights (SDR).",
    "p5": "SDRs basically work like a separate currency with a value calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make it easier for Malaysian airlines to compensate foreigners, and for Malaysians to be compensated by foreign airlines. If your airline does not respond to your claim or does not compensate you fairly, submit a copy of your written complaint and the airline's response to the Malaysian Aviation Commission (MAVCOM)."
